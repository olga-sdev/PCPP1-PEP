"""
Keep code styling convention and functionality balance.
Make exceptions to rules in case:
* better performance and maintainability;
* long line of code because splitting it into two separate lines affects readability;
* compatibility with previously written code: use CamelCase instead of snake_case.
Rules might be broken, exceptions might be made.
