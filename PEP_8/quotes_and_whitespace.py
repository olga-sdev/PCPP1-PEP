"""
In Python there types of quots:
* single-quoted (e.g., 'quotes');
* double-quoted (e.g., "quotes") strings.

Avoid too much whitespace:
* avoid excessive whitespace immediately inside parentheses/brackets/braces;
* immediately before a comma/semicolon/colon;
* after a trailing comma followed by a closing parenthesis;
* immediately before an opening parenthesis that marks the beginning of the argument list of a function invocation;
* immediately before an opening parenthesis that marks the beginning of indexing/slicing;
* no more then one space before and after operators => variable = 2 + 2
* surround the = operator with spaces if itâ€™s used to indicate a keyword argument/default value => def function(y=2)
